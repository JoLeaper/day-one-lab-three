## **My First Day of Alchemy.**

One of the most important things we learned about is the shell, since we will be using it a lot when we become full-fledged developers. I broke the shell commands up into four categories, and they are as follows:

## 1. Shell Commands (Navigation)
```shell
cd . (this changes your directory to the one you are currently in)

cd .. (this changes your directory)

cd - (this changes your directory to the other, most recent directory)

cd ~ (this takes you to your home directory)

cd / (this takes you to your root directory)
```

## 2. Shell Commands (Creating)

```shell
cat filename (this reads content inside the selected file)

echo "text" > filename (rewrites all the text in filename to "text")

echo "text" >> filename (adds "text" to filename without deleting it)
```

## 3. Shell Commands (Modifying/Deleting)

```shell
rm filename (removes filename)

rmdir filename (removes the filename directory, but it has to be empty)

cp (originalfilelocation) (newfilelocation) (this copies a file originalfilelocation to newfilelocation)

mv (originalfilelocation) (newfilelocation) (this moves a file from original file location to new file location)
```

## 4. Shell Commands (Git)

```shell
git clone url (clones the files from the github url to the current location on your device)

git add . (adds the files in the current directory so they're ready to be comitted)

git add -A (adds all the files in the repo so they're ready to be committed)

git commit - m "message" (stages all the added files so they're ready for github)

git push origin master (pushes all the files to github)
```


After learning shell commands and getting more experience with github, we learned some markdown syntax. We learned how to make titles of varying sizes:

# Just
## like
### this!

We also learned how to make tables, so now I can make a chart about numbers!
